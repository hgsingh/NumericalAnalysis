## Synopsis

These are the implementations of deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and context free grammar (CFG) implemented as two separate projects proj1 and proj2 respectively. The language of implementation was chosen to be Python and JSON due to the ease of configurations which the languages provide (the structured notation of JSON and the translation to Python).
